Having the admin screens at `/admin` is a reasonable thing to do. Let's update the routes to make that happen by updating the four routes starting with `/posts` to start with `/admin/posts` instead:

```html
// web/src/Routes.js

<Route path="/admin/posts/new" page={PostNewPostPage} name="newPost" />
<Route path="/admin/posts/{id:Int}/edit" page={PostEditPostPage} name="editPost" />
<Route path="/admin/posts/{id:Int}" page={PostPostPage} name="post" />
<Route path="/admin/posts" page={PostPostsPage} name="posts" />
```

Head to http://localhost:8910/admin/posts and our generated scaffold page should come up. Thanks to named routes we don't have to update any of the `<Link>`s that were generated by the scaffolds since the `name`s of the pages didn't change!

Having the admin at a different path is great, but nothing is stopping someone from just browsing to that new path and messing with our blog posts. How do we keep prying eyes/fingers away?
